## Unix

The Unix operating system and more or less all Unix applications are written in C language however C is not limited to one particular platform and programs can be created on any machine that supports C.

## ANSI

The American National Standards Institute formalized the C language in 1989 and is the recognized standard for the C language.

## Standard C Libraries

ANSI C defines many 'standard' libraries. The libraries contain functions (code that can be re-used repeatedly in a program) contained in 'header files' (with a .h extension) that can be used in C programs. 1/3 of the entire C library is represented by the `<stdio.h>` header file containing input and output functions, types and macro definitions.
