# Breaking out of loops

A `break` keyword is used when requesting to terminate a loop when a specified condition has been met and before its full sequence of iterations have finished. 

This `break` statement should be positioned within the loop statement block and is preceded by a test-expression that is to be met first for the `break` to take actioin and immediately exit the loop with the program moving onto the next task after the loop e.g. in a nested in loop the break statement will proceed to the next iteration of an outer loop.
