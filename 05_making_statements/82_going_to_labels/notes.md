# Going to labels

The `goto` keyword is used in a program when you want it to jump to a label at some other point in the code (just like a hyperlink can on a webpage). 

A valid use of the `goto` keyword is to jump from within an inner nested loop to a label just after the end of its outer loop block immediately exiting both loops with no more iterations occuring. 

The `goto` statement will specify the label by name only and the label jumped to itself is terminated with a colon: (just like the label in a switch statement that uses case:).
