# Calling recursively

Custom functions can call other custom functions in the same way that a standard library function like printf() might be called.

## Functions calling themselves

`Recursive functions` are those that call themselves so that a loop effect occurs. A test expression must be modified (a base case must be met) so that an infinite loop does not occur and the function is allowed to end.
