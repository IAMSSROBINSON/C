# Declaring program constants

Constants are fixed data values that will never change from its initial value. Constants are declared in the same way as variables but constants are prefixed with the keyword const.

It is also customary to declare const VARIABLE_NAMES in uppercase to easily distinguish them from regular variables.

### Syntax:

const data-type-of-content VARIABLE_NAME = someValue;

```C
const int MILLION = 1000000;
```

Arrays can also be declared as const data values provided it is intended that all elements values within the array are never to change.
