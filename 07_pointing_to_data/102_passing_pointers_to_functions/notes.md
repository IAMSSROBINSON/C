# Passing pointers to functions

## Pass by value

Function arguments normally pass their data by 'value' to a 'local variable' inside the called function. This indicates that the function is not operating on the original value but is operating on a copy of it.

## Pass by reference 

Passing a pointer to the function instead allows the called function to operate on the 'original data value'. This is pass by 'reference' technique is a fundamental reason for using pointers.
