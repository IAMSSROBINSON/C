# Creating arrays of pointers

An array of pointers will contain elements that each store the address of other variables.

## Char arrays are pointers

Character arrays (strings) can be assigned to a pointer. The name of the string char array acts like a pointer to the first element in that array already so the & (addressof) operator is not required when assigning a char array to a pointer variable. 

The whole string in a char array is referenced with the name alone and no *deference operator is required.
