# Doing arithmetic

The usual arithmetic operators are used to perform operations (with parenthesis being used to clarify the order and precedence of expressions):

<br>

|Operator | Operation|
|:------- |:---------|
|+				| Addition 		|
|-				| Subtraction |
|*				| Multiplication |
|/				| Division |
|%				| Modulus |
|++				| Increment |
|--				| Decrement |

<br>

## Modulus %

This operator divides a given number by a second given number and returns the remainder. 
If the remainder is 0 the given number is of 'even' value.
If the remainder is 1 the given number is of 'odd' value.

<br>

## Increment operator ++

This operator increases a given number by +1 and returns the new value and are most notably used to increment the index of a loop to count iterations.


<br>

## Decrement operator --

This operator decreases a given number by -1 and returns the new value and are most notably used to decrement the index of a loop to count down iterations.

<br>

### Pre-increment / decrement operator: ++Number / --Number

If placed / prefixed before the operand (the number in question) the value is changed immediately and then returned. 

<br>

### Post-increment / decrement operator: Number++ / Number--

If placed / postfixed after the operand (the number in question) the value is returned and then changed after returning / the next time it is referenced.
