# Comparing values

Operators used to compare two numerical values:

|Operator |Description								|				
|:--------|:--------------------------|
|==				|Equality										|	
|!=				|Inequality									|
|>				|Greater than 							|
|<				|Less than									|
|>=				|Greater than or equal to 	|
|<=				|Less than or equal to 			|

## Equality ==
Compares the value of two operands and returns 1(true) if they are equal, otherwise 0(false). If both are the same number they are considered equal and if both are characters their ASCII code values are compared numberically.

## Inequality !=
Inequality operator is used vastly in conditional branching to determine a route. It returns 1(true) if operands are not equal, otherwise 0(false). 

## > Greater than
Greater than operator is frequently used to test the countdown value in a loop and returns 1(true) if the first operand is greater than the second or 0(false) if equal to or less than.

## < Less than
The less than operator returns 1(true) if the first operand is less than the second and 0(false) if otherwise.

## >= Greater than or equal to
Returns 1(true) if the first operand is greater in value or equal to in value as compared to the value of the second operand otherwise it will return 0(false).

## <= Less than or equal to
Returns 1(true) if the first operand is less in value or equal to in value as compared to the value of the second operand otherwise it will return 0(false).
