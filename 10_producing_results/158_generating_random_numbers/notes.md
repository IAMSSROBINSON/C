# Generating random numbers

`rand();` function
- from `<stdlib.h>
- generates pseudo-random positive integer
- from 0 to a larger number (up to at least 32,767)
- a specific range can be set using % operator to specify upper limit e.g. range from 0 - 9 rand() % 9
- to set min limit its value can be added to the result of the expression e.g. (rand() % 9) + 1 to specify a range of 1 - 10.

## Sequence

The numbers generated are not truly random as the same sequence is generated each time the rand() function is executed. To generate a different sequence the 'seed' that starts the sequence off should be specified.

- by default the seed is 1 
- provide alternative `srand()` interger e.g. `srand(8)`, will cause `rand()` to generate a different sequence of numbers

## Different successive sequence

To generate a different sequence on successive execution of the same `srand(integer)` a static integer must not be provided and it should change e.g. by seeding the `rand()` function with 'current time elapsed in seconds with `srand(time(NULL))` so that the sequence generated by `rand()` will be different each time a program using `rand()` is executed.
