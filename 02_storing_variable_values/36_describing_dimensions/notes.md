# Describing dimension

The numbering of array elements is known as array index and the element counting starts at 0 - this is known as a 'zero based index'.

An array created with a single index is a called a one-dimensional array: These elements appear in a single row:	

<br>

|Element content|A|B|C|D|
|:----------|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Index number   |0|1|2|3|


<br>

## Multiple Indicies

Arrays can have multiple indices which correspond with multiple dimensions. An array with 2 indices is a 'two dimensional array' and elements are aligned over two rows.

### Values

The values contained in each array of a multi-dimensional array is referened by stating the number of each index. If more than 1 array the initial array will be at index 0 and the second array will be at index 1 and the elements within them start counting again from 0 for the initial element and then 1 for the second and so on for each element. This means the first initial element in the initial array is at index[0][0]. Arrays can also accommodate three-dimensions and more but are seldom used.
